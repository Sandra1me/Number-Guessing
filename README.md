# Number Guessing

This program is a mini-game in which MATLAB will generate a random number, and the user will need to guess it. 

It will give two initial hints for the user to start guessing and will tell if the number to find is bigger or smaller than the one proposed by the player.

It will also record the numbers the player tried and the number of fails.

You can find the version with GUI and the MATLAB command window version.

## Usage

To play the game, run the NumberGuessing.m script, and it will start generating a random number and the initial clues. You can run the program from the NumberGuessing.m file in the editor window or by calling the NumberGuessing script in your MATLAB console (if you are in the same folder, type the name, if not, write the full directory address).

The game will go on until the user guesses the game. After that, you can rerun it to play another round.

It will keep a record and inform you of the numbers you tried and the failures you made.

If you don't have MATLAB, install the app by running the MyAppInstaller_web.exe file to install the game. Then, run the installed file.
